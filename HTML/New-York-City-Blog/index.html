                <p>New York City is composed of five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten
                    Island. Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of New York State, making New York City
                    the largest U.S. municipality situated in multiple counties. The boroughs of Queens and the Bronx
                    are also Queens County and Bronx County. The other three counties are named differently from their
                    boroughs: Manhattan is New York County, Brooklyn is Kings County, and Staten Island is Richmond
                    County.</p>
